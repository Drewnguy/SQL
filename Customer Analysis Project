In this project I will be querying a database of customers and product sales.

1. Write a query that will remove unusable data from the customers table.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE LENGTH(order_id)=6
AND order_id<>’Order ID’;

2. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID<>’Order ID’
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

3. How many orders were placed for an iPhone in January?
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

4. Select all customer account numbers of orders placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON feb.orderID=c.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID’;

5. What is the total revenue for each product in January?

SELECT product, 
SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

6. What products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, 
SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold,
SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue,
location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON feb.orderID=c.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>1
AND LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID<>'Order ID';

8. List all products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product,
SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

9. What product brought in the most revenue in January?

SELECT Product,
SUM(Quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;

10. Which locations in New York made at least 3 orders in January?

SELECT location,
COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
AND orderID<>'ORDER ID'
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2;

11. How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?

SELECT 
Product,
SUM(Quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

12. What is the average spend per account in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON c.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID<>'Order ID’;

13. What is the average quantity of product bought per account in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON c.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID<>'Order ID';
