In this project I will be querying a database of customers and product sales.

Write a query that will remove unusable data from the customers table:
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE LENGTH(order_id)=6
AND order_id<>’Order ID’;

How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID<>’Order ID’
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

How many orders were placed for an iPhone in January?
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND orderID<>'Order ID'
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

Select all customer account numbers of orders placed in February:
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customer
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb_id
ON feb_id.orderID=customer.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>'Order ID’;

What is the total revenue for each product in January?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

What products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold
SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue,
location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>1
AND LENGTH(feb.orderID)=6
AND feb.orderID<>'Order ID'

List all products sold in Los Angeles in February and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product,
SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
